Have used wrong syntax "subeq" at two points.

Correction:
Changed both "subeq" to "subseteq"

Fixed:
--- Syntax error. "club.zbx" Line 22, near ";"
	Expecting: "=" "in" (infix relation symbol) "_inrel-id_"
>>>	committee subeq members ;
--- Syntax error. "club.zbx" Line 26, near "	-------------------------------------
"
	Expecting: "=" "in" (infix relation symbol) "_inrel-id_"

Type mismatch of LHS and RHS of a system invariant at "committee <= MaximumCommitteeSize".

Correction:
Used cardinality of committee. So the correction is "# committee <= MaximumCommitteeSize"

Fixed:
--- Typing error. "club.zbx" Line 23. Type mismatch: Infix relation.

Error 04

"president" has defined as a subset of "committee" set which is not true.
"president" is an element of "committee" set.

Correction:
Changed "president subseteq committee" to "president in committee".

Fixed:
--- Typing error. "club.zbx" Line 24. Type mismatch: Infix relation.
>>>	president subseteq committee
	Expected LHS type: (P [X])
	Actual LHS type: STUDENT
	Expected RHS type: (P [X])

Error 05
========
Type mismatch of LHS and RHS of a system invariant at "members < MaximumClubSize".

Correction:
Used cardinality of members. So the correction is "# members < MaximumClubSize"

Fixed:
--- Typing error. "club.zbx" Line 34. Type mismatch: Infix relation.
>>>	members < MaximumClubSize
	Expected LHS type: Z
	Actual LHS type: (P STUDENT)
	Expected RHS type: Z

Error 06
========
Type mismatch in "set union" at "members || newmember?" since the "newmember?"
is not an element of power set of STUDENT as "members" is.
"newmember?" is only an element of STUDENT.

Correction:
Changed "newmember?" to "{ newmember? }" so it becomes an element of power set
of STUDENT.

Fixed:
--- Typing error. "club.zbx" Line 35. Type mismatch: Infix expression
>>>	members || newmember?
	Expected type of the infix expression: ((P [X]) x (P [X]))
--- Typing error. "club.zbx" Line 35. Type mismatch: Right-hand side
>>>	newmember?
	Expected type: (P STUDENT)
	Actual type: STUDENT
