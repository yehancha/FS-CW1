Changed both "subeq" to "subseteq"

Fixed:
--- Syntax error. "club.zbx" Line 22, near ";"
	Expecting: "=" "in" (infix relation symbol) "_inrel-id_"
>>>	committee subeq members ;
--- Syntax error. "club.zbx" Line 26, near "	-------------------------------------
"
	Expecting: "=" "in" (infix relation symbol) "_inrel-id_"
>>>		-------------------------------------
